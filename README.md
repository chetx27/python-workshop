# Comprehensive Jupyter Notebook Projects and PyQt5 GUIs

This repository is a consolidated collection of Jupyter notebooks and PyQt5 GUI application source code showcasing a variety of learning projects, exercises, and research-related programming work.

---

## Contents Overview

### Mathematical and Programming Foundations
- Implements reusable mathematical functions and algorithms for computational tasks.
- Covers foundation-level to intermediate-level programming concepts in Python.
- Contains utility functions, problem-solving exercises, and algorithm examples.

### GUI Application Development
- PyQt5-based GUI forms and windows with interactive widgets like input fields, buttons, and labels.
- Creating user input forms for first/last name inputs, login pages, and interactive UI components.
- Event-driven programming including button click handlers and dynamic UI updates.

### Learning and Practice Notebooks
- Annotated notebooks for daily coding practice ("day1.ipynb", "Day-02.ipynb") covering core programming, data structures, and UI interactions.
- Experimental notebooks ("Untitled.ipynb", "Untitled1.ipynb") containing small trials, reusable code snippets, and feature testing.
- Focus on hands-on learning with instant feedback via print statements and UI label updates.

### Specific Notebooks Details
- `Math-lib-functions.ipynb`: A compilation of mathematical functions implemented in Python for educational and utility purposes.
- `GUI_day-3.ipynb`, `namepage.ipynb`, `loginpage.ipynb`: Multiple notebooks containing PyQt5 GUI window designs, event handling, and user interaction examples.
- `day1.ipynb`, `Day-02.ipynb`: Progressive notebooks for introductory to intermediate programming concepts, including algorithms and UI programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ installed on your local machine
- Recommended: Anaconda distribution for easy environment setup
- Jupyter Notebook for viewing and running `.ipynb` files
- Required Python packages (install via pip):



(You may need additional packages depending on notebook content, like `numpy`, `matplotlib`.)

### Running the Notebooks and GUI

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:


3. Open any `.ipynb` notebook file you want to explore.

4. To run PyQt5 code (e.g., from `GUI_day-3.ipynb` or script files), run the Python file or notebook cell containing the GUI setup code.
